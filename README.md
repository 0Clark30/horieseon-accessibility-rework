# Horieseon Accessibility Rework

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
Using the Content learned throughout the bootcamp thus far I wanted to follow the instructions and work through mistakes, as to me mistakes are where the learning happens.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
To make the code cleaner for other developers coming after me hypothetically speaking. The art of doing and showing up are fundamental to learning. Additionally I was excited to make mistakes, because that indicated there was learning to do.
- What problem does it solve?
Scaling up organization within html and css. This lead to breaks between the styling and the html, until the code was restructered.
- What did you learn?
Firstly, the principle of leaving code cleaner than you found it. I discovered it is useful to include like code within the same "{}" as long as you can seperate the selectors with a comma. Secondly I discovered the origin of semantic HTML and its purpose. Lastly I learned that it is necessary to check for stupid mistakes like the href, id mistake affecting the nav.
